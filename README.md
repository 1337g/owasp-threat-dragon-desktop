# [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon #

Threat Dragon is an threat modelling application including system diagramming and a rule engine to auto-generate threats/mitigations. It is an [OWASP Incubator Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Threat_Dragon). The focus will be on great UX, a powerful rule engine and integration with other development lifecycle tools.

This repository contains the files for the desktop variant. For more info, go to [the main project repo](https://github.com/mike-goodwin/owasp-threat-dragon).

The desktop variant is a work-in progress, but it basically works. There is not installer (yet) so you have to clone the repo and install it:

`git clone https://github.com/mike-goodwin/owasp-threat-dragon-desktop`
`npm install`

Then to run it on a Mac:

`./node_modules/.bin/electron .`

Or on Windows:

`.\node_modules\.bin\electron .`
