# [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon #

Threat Dragon is an threat modelling application including system diagramming and a rule engine to auto-generate threats/mitigations. It is an [OWASP Incubator Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Threat_Dragon). The focus will be on great UX, a powerful rule engine and integration with other development lifecycle tools.

This repository contains the files for the desktop variant. For more info, go to [the main project repo](https://github.com/mike-goodwin/owasp-threat-dragon).
